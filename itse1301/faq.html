          <dd>
            A jackal is a type of canine related to dogs and coyotes. Native to
            Africa and Eurasia, it has coloring like a German Shepherd and a build
            like a tall, slender fox with a fluffy tail. It's also a term used to
            describe a devoted group of Late Night fans that like to point out
            mistakes made on the show. This lead to the creation of the
            Emmy-nominated segment <em>Corrections</em>, in which Seth
            acknowledges these jackals contributions and their absurdity.<br><a href="#top">Top</a>

            <dd class="w3-container w3-hover-amber w3-round-large">
              A jackal is a type of canine related to dogs and coyotes. Native to
              Africa and Eurasia, it has coloring like a German Shepherd and a build
              like a tall, slender fox with a fluffy tail. It's also a term used to
              describe a devoted group of Late Night fans that like to point out
              mistakes made on the show. This lead to the creation of the
              Emmy-nominated segment <em>Corrections</em>, in which Seth
              acknowledges these jackals contributions and their absurdity.<br><a href="#top" class="w3-btn w3-right">Top</a>
